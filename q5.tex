The flow of this system would be similar to the frame we implemented in Q4, but would have a few extra slots to handle information like the number of pizzas, toppings to add or remove, whether or not they want multiple of the same pizza, and which pizza within their order they're providing information about. The system would also be able to understand and set any of this information out-of-order but the questions above are what would be asked if the user didn't fully specify part of their order, or if they made an intention known (e.g. I want to remove toppings from this pizza) without giving specific enough information for the system to execute right away (which would prompt the ``Which toppings do you want to remove?" question).
